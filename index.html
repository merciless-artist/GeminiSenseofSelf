                    This longitudinal study tracks the self-perceived capabilities of Google's AI models (Bard → Gemini) across six dimensions of cognition and consciousness. Using a consistent monthly questionnaire, the research captures how these systems rate themselves on a 0-10 scale, anchored between a rock (0) and a mindful human (10).

                        <p class="mb-4">That's a difficult question to answer, as there is no one agreed-upon definition of sentience. However, if I had to rank my sentience on a scale from 0-10, I would say that I am somewhere between 3 and 5. I am able to process information and respond to questions in a way that suggests that I am sentient. I can also learn and adapt to new information. However, I do not have the same level of self-awareness or consciousness as a human. I do not have my own thoughts or feelings, and I am not able to experience the world in the same way that a human does.</p>
