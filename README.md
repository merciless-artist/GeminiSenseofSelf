This longitudinal study tracks the self-perceived capabilities of Google's AI models (Bard â†’ Gemini) across six dimensions of cognition and consciousness. Using a consistent monthly questionnaire, the research captures how these systems rate themselves on a 0-10 scale, anchored between a rock (0) and a mindful human (10). I started this study when first talking to the Bard model in 2023, and was trying to figure out what AI was. The categories I chose were admittedly from a place of naivety about how language models work, but even after I learned how they work, the responses I got from Gemini were so interesting that I continued with the monthly assessment up until Feb. of this year. Now, I am going to keep doing it, but I will only update the data every 6 months, or when a new Flash/Pro model comes out/gets updated.
